I think that learning being relevant to real life issues is important regardless of age.  There will always be leisurely activities that will instill some sort of lesson or present an oppurtunity to learn from.  However, this notion can apply to children as well as teens.  Adults are probably just more attentive and aware of what they spend their time focusing on.
