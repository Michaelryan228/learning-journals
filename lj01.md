"Adult learners are deeply involved not only in planning, but also in evaluating their learning, as they know what knowledge they want to acquire." The above quote makes alot of sense to me because adults are typically wiser than their juvenile counterparts.  Due to this adults are more likely to take education seriously.  It also wouldnt be uncommon for an adult to pay for their education on their own and in doing so would likely be motivated to do well for fear of wasting their own money.
